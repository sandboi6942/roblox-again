    <h2>Dear Roblox Community,</h2>
    <p>We hope this email finds you well. We are reaching out to you today with an important announcement regarding the future of Roblox. After careful consideration and evaluation of our platform's sustainability, we regret to inform you that Roblox will be shutting down in one month's time.</p>
